# Overview

This demo application demonstrates how PostgreSQL database connection pooling works with SQLAlchemy in Python. It provides a practical understanding of connection pool behavior, lifecycle, and resource management without diving into production code.

## Purpose

The primary goal is to visualize and understand:

- How connection pools manage database connections
- Connection acquisition and release patterns
- Pool exhaustion scenarios
- Connection lifecycle (creation, checkout, checkin, disposal)
- Impact of pool configuration on application performance
- Common connection pool issues and their solutions
