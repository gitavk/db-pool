# Monitoring and Metrics

## Real-time Statistics

The demo displays:

- **Current pool size**: Active connections in the pool
- **Checked out connections**: Currently in use
- **Overflow connections**: Temporary connections beyond pool_size
- **Queue size**: Clients waiting for connections
- **Total checkouts**: Lifetime connection borrows
- **Average checkout time**: Time connections spend checked out

## Performance Metrics

- Connection acquisition time
- Query execution time
- Connection wait time
- Pool utilization percentage
- Connection creation rate
